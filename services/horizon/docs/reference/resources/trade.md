A trade occurs when offers are completely or partially fulfilled.  For example, let's say that there exists an offer to sell 9 `foo_bank/EUR` for 3 `baz_exchange/BTC` and you make an offer to buy 3 `foo_bank/EUR` for 1 `baz_exchange/BTC`.  Since your offer and the existing one cross, a trade happens.  After the trade completes,

- you are 3 `foo_bank/EUR` richer and 1 `baz_exchange/BTC` poorer
- the maker of the other offer is 1 `baz_exchange/BTC` richer and 3 `foo_bank/EUR` poorer
- your offer is completely fulfilled and no longer exists
- the other offer is partially fulfilled and becomes an offer to sell 6 `foo_bank/EUR` for 2 `baz_exchange/BTC`.  The price of that offer doesn't change, but the amount does.

Trades can also be caused by successful [path payments](https://www.stellar.org/developers/learn/concepts/exchange.html), because path payments involve fulfilling offers.

Payments are one-way in that afterwards, the source account has a smaller balance and the destination account of the payment has a bigger one.  Trades are two-way; both accounts increase and decrease their balances.
